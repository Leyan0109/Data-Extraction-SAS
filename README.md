# ðŸ‘¶ Gender Prediction by Name â€” Data Extraction & Analysis Using SAS

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This assignment uses data from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gender+by+Name) to perform data extraction and analysis using **SAS**. The dataset contains names from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, along with associated gender labels. The aim is to investigate naming patterns, gender associations, and cross-country comparisons.
